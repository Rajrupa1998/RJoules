# RJoules
Towards Energy Efficient R Programming
# Description
RJoules measures the energy consumption of R code snippeton Intel processor and provides domain-level granular results. This tool can be serves as a valuable resource for developers and practitioners seeking to develop energy-aware applications using the R languaguage. 

# System Requirements
1. Intel processors from the Celeron, Pentium, Core i3, i7, i9, and Xeon series, featuring the Sandy Bridge or newer architecture.</li>
2. Linux distribution Debian based operating system. We have tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04 Versions(recommended).</li>
3. Have <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a> installed in your system.</li>

# Steps to run
1. Clone the repository using ```git clone https://github.com/rishalab/RJoules.git```
2. Navigate into the RJoules_main directory```cd RJoules_main``` ```pwd```
3. For testing we have provided few test files here<a href=""></a>, hence STEP3 to STEP6 can be avoided, just run the below command
 ```TESTFILENAME.R```


# Usage
1. Measuring energy consumption due to R code snippets.
2. Check energy consumption of machine learning models developed in R
